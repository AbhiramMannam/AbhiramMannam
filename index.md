***Home Default Risk***

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To ensure this underserved population has a favorable loan experience, Home Credit uses various alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

These notebooks will examine the Home Credit default risk Exploration Data Analysis with data cleaning, explorations, hypothesis questions, and visualizations. Subsequently, we develop predictive models using the cleaned data to assess credit default risk. We focus on the target variable and employ different machine learning models, calculating relevant metrics like accuracy and ROC values.
