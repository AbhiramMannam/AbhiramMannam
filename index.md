***Home Default Risk***

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To ensure this underserved population has a favorable loan experience, Home Credit uses various alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

These notebooks will examine the Home Credit default risk Exploration Data Analysis with data cleaning, explorations, hypothesis questions, and visualizations. Subsequently, we develop predictive models using the cleaned data to assess credit default risk. We focus on the target variable and employ different machine learning models, calculating relevant metrics like accuracy and ROC values.

***Iowa Home Price Prediction***

Every home buyer needs to buy their dream house, but estimating the cost of the house is difficult. So, this model will estimate the price of the house using the variables (predictors) from the house. 

This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a model that estimates house prices in Ames, Iowa, using readily available information about the houses themselves. The main aim of this project is to predict the house prices in Ames, Iowa, with the given variables (predictors) and predict the SalePrice (Target Variable). We start with the data collection from the Kaggle and clean and Explore the data as part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Later, we define the statistical machine-learning model linear regression to predict the prices of houses in Ames, Iowa.
