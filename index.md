## Projects

***SWIRE - COCA COLA Forecasting***

Swire Coca-Cola, USA, is responsible for producing, selling, and distributing Coca-Cola and various beverages across 13 states in the American West. The company is committed to continuously introducing innovative products into the market. Swire aims to enhance its production planning and management specifically for these products. The primary challenge requires accurately forecasting the demand to mitigate instances of out-of-stock and overproduction, thereby maximizing profits.

The notebooks examine the regular products that closely resemble the specified innovative products and forecast sales by leveraging the sales data of these similar products. Determine the most relevant similar products based on factors such as brand, market category, manufacturer, package type, and/or flavor, matching the specifications of the specified innovative products. Analyze the weekly sales figures of these similar products. Aggregate the sales data of these products to predict the sales of the innovative products.

***Home Default Risk***

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To ensure this underserved population has a favorable loan experience, Home Credit uses various alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

These notebooks examine the Home Credit default risk Exploration Data Analysis with data cleaning, explorations, hypothesis questions, and visualizations. Subsequently, we developed predictive models using the cleaned data to assess credit default risk. We focused on the target variable and employed different machine learning models, calculating relevant metrics like accuracy and ROC values, and achieved 0.73 accuracy.

***Iowa Home Price Prediction***

Every home buyer needs to buy their dream house, but estimating the cost of the house is difficult. So, building the statistical machine learning model will estimate the price of the house using the variables (predictors) from the house. 

This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a model that estimates house prices in Ames, Iowa, using readily available information about the prices of houses themselves. The main aim of this project is to predict the house prices in Ames, Iowa, with the given variables (predictors) and predict the SalePrice (Target Variable). We start with the data collection from the Kaggle and clean and Explore the data as part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Later, we defined the statistical machine-learning model linear regression to predict the prices of houses in Ames, Iowa, which resulted in 0.9 accuracy.
