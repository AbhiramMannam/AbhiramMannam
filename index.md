[Home Default Risk]

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To ensure this underserved population has a favorable loan experience, Home Credit uses various alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

These notebooks will examine the Home Credit default risk Exploration Data Analysis with data cleaning, explorations, hypothesis questions, and visualizations.

In this EDA, we will use the Application (Train/ Test) dataset and the Bureau dataset to perform the hypothesis test and clean the datasets along with transactional data analysis with the Bureau dataset. Depending on the hypothesis questions, we will also visualize some plots, like whether men or women tend to default more, whether income or credit sum affects the default, and whether the client's region, occupation, and family structure affect the default rate.

Subsequently, we develop predictive models using the cleaned data to assess credit default risk. We focus on the target variable and employ different machine learning models, calculating relevant metrics like accuracy and ROC values.

The objective is to identify the best-performing model based on Kaggle scores. We start with Logistic regression and then explore penalized regression, specifically LASSO, due to collinearity issues. Additionally, we examine Random Forest, XGBoost, and Light XGBoost to assess their effectiveness in predicting credit default risk.
